# Sales Data Analysis
## Overview

This project looks at sales data to find important patterns, such as:
- The best months for sales
- The cities with the highest sales
- The best time to show ads
- Products that are often bought together
- The top-selling products

I used Python, pandas, and matplotlib to do the analysis and create graphs.

## Analysis Questions
1. What is the best month for sales?
2. Which city has the highest sales?
3. When should we show ads to get more sales?
4. What products are often bought together?
5. What product sold the most?
